# Facts to know:

1. This is the ultimate Gmail clone that is fully functional with REALTIME Email sending and recieving logic system between multiple users.

2. The Backend system is developed with firebase v8.3.0 that is resposibl for the google authetication of the users that includes the login and logout functionalities.

3. Firebase is also used for storing the input email data of the users (That includes resipients name, subject and the email body within the compose section) inside the database that is responsible for controlling the email sending and recieving functionalities.

4. React Redux Toolkit has also been used to setup the system which is my most favourite package of React.

5. With the help of React props drilling method, Redux Toolkit and pure React States I have made the gmail clone web app fully functional just like the original time with Real Time data fetching capabilities..

Now let's come down to how you can use the app..
